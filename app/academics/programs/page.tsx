        Our preschool program is grounded in the <em>Creative Curriculum®</em>, developed by
        Teaching Strategies, LLC in 1980. This research‑based approach supports the cognitive,
        social‑emotional, physical, and language development of each child. Teachers serve as
        facilitators, creating meaningful connections between children and their environment.
        Learning is personalized, with activities and projects guided by each child’s interests —
        encouraging autonomy, curiosity, and a lifelong love of learning.

        Our elementary program is built on key pillars that support each child’s academic and
        personal growth. We emphasize strong routines, team‑building experiences, and a balance
        between structure and independence. Our curriculum fosters curiosity — especially in English,
        math, and science — while promoting core values that encourage students to become
        compassionate, community‑minded individuals. Each child is guided to learn at their own pace,
        developing confidence and a genuine love for learning.

        speaking, research, and negotiation skills through our Model United Nations (HSMun / MiniMun)
        program. Integration with our arts curriculum nurtures discipline and creativity. Students
        build independence and find their own voice through problem‑solving and negotiation
        activities. Technology plays a key role, featuring robotics labs and lessons on AI ethics.

        Volunteering and learning driven by curiosity and individual interests are key components.
        Students receive personalized one‑on‑one support for college and university planning. We also
        celebrate the journey of our arts program, recognizing its vital role in shaping well‑rounded
        individuals.
